# Welcome!

This is a very simple JavaScript implementation of the [Little Man Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_man_computer) - nothing fancy going on here, but it was pretty fun to work on personally!

## To Run:

- Clone the project
- `npm install` to download [`prompt-sync`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prompt-sync), a utility package for simple synchronous command-line input
- Edit the `index.lmc` file to load up a program - right now the computer will run a program to input two numbers and output their sum.
- Find some example programs in the `examples/` folder, helpfully stolen from the Wikipedia Page for the LMC.
- `npm start` to run the computer!

Enjoy!
